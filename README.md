request. For further information please contact [support@vitalpbx.com](mailto:support@vitalpbx.com).

There are two ways of localizing Sonata Billing. The preferred method is to use GitHub as it allows you be notified of future changes and updates. It has multiple tutorials for Mac, Windows and Linux on setting up and working with GIT as well as [desktop clients](https://desktop.github.com/):

1. [Create a github account](https://github.com/join) (if you don't have one already)
2. [Fork the Sonata Billing localization repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
3. [Clone your forked repository to your desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/)
4. [Create and commit changes](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/making-changes-in-a-branch/)
5. [Push commits to your github repository](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/syncing-your-branch/)
6. [Issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/sending-a-pull-request/)

Creating a new localization involves creating a new folder (copy en\_US). You can then start localizing. The localization files follow a simple symbol = "text" format. Only the text part must be translated.
